   <p>Dear $firstname,</p>
<p>Building Kidz has achieved some significant growth lately. With 71 signed franchise agreements and 39 locations open across 9 states, <a href="https://www.buildingkidzschool.com/franchisees-helping-children/">Building Kidz School </a> is now poised for its next phase of expansion. To facilitate, we are actively pursuing strategic franchise relationships across the country. </p>
<h2>A Bit of Background</h2>
  <p>Vineeta Bhandari’s entry into the preschool sector was not only driven by entrepreneurship but by necessity. </p>
<p>$variableParagraph</p>
<p>After thorough research, Vineeta designed a high-quality curriculum focused on 
“Whole Child Learning”; emphasizing social and emotional development alongside academic excellence. Her goal was to establish an academic institution that incorporates performing arts and life experiences into its teaching methodology, while also integrating STEM education and a unique proprietary curriculum.
</p>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Building Kidz system is thriving. Our growth is making a difference, as well; Building Kidz uses 25% of its profits to aid and support orphan and abandoned children globally. </p>
<p>With growing demand for quality education nationwide and increasing waiting lists for learning centers and daycares, the Building Kidz School Franchise offers entrepreneurs the opportunity to positively impact the next generation, while operating a preschool with the strongest margins in the industry.</p>

All the best,
